# Unsupervised Learning

### Introduction

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where models discover patterns, structures, or groupings in data without the use of labeled outputs. The algorithm learns solely from input features, aiming to identify hidden relationships or reduce dimensional complexity.

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised methods do not rely on predefined labels, making them well-suited for exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, and feature extraction.

### Core Concepts

- **Unlabeled Data**: The input consists only of feature vectors `x`, with no corresponding target values.
- **Pattern Discovery**: The algorithm searches for natural groupings, structures, or lower-dimensional representations.
- **Model Output**: Typically consists of clusters or new feature sets.

### Learning Tasks

1. **Clustering**: Groups data points into clusters (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN).
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compresses data while preserving essential structure (e.g., PCA, SVD).

### Advantages

- **No Labeled Data Required**: Useful in domains where labeling is impractical or unavailable.
- **Data Exploration**: Reveals hidden patterns and structures that may not be obvious.

### Challenges

- **Interpretability**: Results are harder to evaluate without knowing what groups actually exist.
- **Unstable Results**: Outcomes may vary based on algorithm settings or initial conditions.
- **Validation Difficulty**: Lacking labels, itâ€™s harder to measure accuracy or performance objectively.
- **Sensitive to Parameters**: Choice of distance metric, number of clusters, or dimensions can greatly influence results.

### Summary

Unsupervised learning offers powerful tools for discovering structure in unlabeled data. While its evaluation can be less straightforward, it is invaluable for exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and scenarios where labeled data is scarce or unavailable.
