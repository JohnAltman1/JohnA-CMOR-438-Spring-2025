# K-Means Clustering Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.

## Dataset

The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to the **Seeds** dataset, sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset has 3 groups, which I wanted instead of just a binary model like with perceptrons.

## Notebook Contents

The **K-Means Clustering Notebook** in this folder contains explanations of the K-Means clustering technique and demonstrations of its use on the **Seeds** dataset.
