# DBSCAN Clustering Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm.

## Dataset

The DBSCAN clustering algorithm is applied to the **Seeds** dataset, sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset is used to test the ability of DBSCAN to identify clusters of varying densities, especially with a dataset like this that has significant overlapping.

## Notebook Contents

The **DBSCAN Clustering Notebook** in this folder contains explanations of the DBSCAN clustering technique and demonstrations of its use on the **Seeds** dataset.
