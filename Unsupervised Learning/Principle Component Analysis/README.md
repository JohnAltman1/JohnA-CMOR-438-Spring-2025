# Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique.

## Dataset

The PCA technique is applied to the **Seeds** dataset, sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset is used to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, particularly on this dataset as there are multiple values that are closely correlated such as area and perimter.

## Notebook Contents

The **PCA Notebook** in this folder contains explanations of the PCA technique and demonstrations of its use on the **Seeds** dataset.
