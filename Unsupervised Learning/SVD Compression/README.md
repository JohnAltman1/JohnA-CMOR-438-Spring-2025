# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) image compression technique.

## Dataset

The SVD technique is applied to the **Seeds** dataset, sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset is used to demonstrate dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, particularly on this dataset as there are multiple values that are closely correlated such as area and perimeter.

## Notebook Contents

The **SVD Notebook** in this folder contains explanations of the SVD technique and demonstrations of its use on the **Seeds** dataset.
