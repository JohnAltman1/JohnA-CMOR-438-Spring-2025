# K Nearest Neighbors Algorithm Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

## Dataset

The KNN algorithm is applied to the **Seeds** dataset, sourced from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/236/seeds). This dataset has 3 groups, which I wanted instead of just a binary model like with perceptrons.

## Notebook Contents

The **K Nearest Neighbors Notebook** in this folder contains an explanation of the KNN algorithm, and a demonstration of its use on the **Seeds** dataset.
