# Neural Networks Implementation

This folder contains an implementation of neural networks for supervised learning tasks.

## Dataset

The neural network model is applied to the **EMNIST** dataset, which is an extended dataset of handwritten characters. We only look at letters for this model, classifying the images to the appropriate letters.
## Notebook Contents

The **Neural Networks Notebook** in this folder contains an explanation of neural network architectures, and a demonstration of their application to the **Banknote Authentication** dataset.
